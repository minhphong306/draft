Dear A,
First of all, I would like to thank you for creating one of these great foundational programming courses. By providing specific lectures, your course has been really easy to understand, and it is especially useful to those who are just starting out or just started learning Vue. It's amazing.
I really expected to be able to expand my knowledge from the course with the amount that I spent. However, as a longtime programmer, it is quite regrettable that I did not get much value from this course. Therefore, I would like to request a refund for this course.
I will look forward to your future courses and continue to support you, but at the moment, I hope you will understand and accept my request as the course purchased has not been able to meet my expectations. 
Sincerely thanks,
